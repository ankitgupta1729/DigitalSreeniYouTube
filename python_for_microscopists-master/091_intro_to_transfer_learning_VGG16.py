#Load the VGG model. For the first time it downloads weights from the Internet.
#Stored in Keras/Models directory. (Almost 600MB)
#We can include arguments to define whether we want to download full model, 
#Or part only, include weights, classes, etc.

#Let us load an image to test the pretrained VGG model.
#These models are developed on powerful computers so we may as well use them for transfer learning
#For VGG16 the images need to be 224x224.
