"""
Clean up of the Nuclei dataset 
Can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipateam/nuinsseg?resource=download

The dataset comes with a lot of subdirectories that can be very useful depending
on the task of your interest. For our Detectron2 and YOLOv8 training, we just 
need the raw images and labeled masks that we will convert to appropriate formats. 
So let us delete all unwanted data and keep only the raw images, binary masks 
and label masks. I am keeping binary masks for other exercises. 

Keep the directories with names 'tissue images', 'mask binary without border', and 'label masks modify'
