Histogram equalization: 
Stretches histogram to include all ranges if the original histogram is confined
only to a small region - low contrast images. 
But, this type of stretching may not result in ideal results and gives 
too bright and too dark regions in the image. This can be very bad for images
with large intensity variations. 

CLAHE: COntrast limited adaptive histogram equalization
Regular histogram equalization uses global contrast of the image. This results in
too bright and too dark regions as the histogram stretches and is not confined
to specific region.

Adaptive histogram equalization divides the image into small tiles and within 
each tile the histogram is equalized. Tile size is typically 8x8. 
If theimage contains noise, it gets amplified during this process. Therefore, 
contrast limiting is applied to limit the contrast below a specific limit.
Bilinear interpolation is performed between tile borders. 

Below, let us perform both histogram equalization and CLAHE and compare the results. 
The best way to work with color images is by converting them to luminance space,
e.g. LAB, and enhancing lumincnace channel only and eventually combining all channels.
