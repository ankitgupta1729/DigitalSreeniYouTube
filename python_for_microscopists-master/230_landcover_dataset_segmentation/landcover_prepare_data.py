The following code performs these tasks - relevant to work with landcover dataset
from here: https://landcover.ai/

Code can be modified to work with any other dataset.

Tasks achieved.

1. Read large images and corresponding masks, divide them into smaller patches.
And write the patches as images to the local drive.  

2. Save only images and masks where masks have some decent amount of labels other than 0. 
Using blank images with label=0 is a waste of time and may bias the model towards 
unlabeled pixels. 

3. Divide the sorted dataset from above into train and validation datasets. 

4. You have to manually move some folders and rename appropriately if you want to use 
ImageDataGenerator from keras.
