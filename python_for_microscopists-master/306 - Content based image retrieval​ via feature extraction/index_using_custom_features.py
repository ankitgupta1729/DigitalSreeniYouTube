@author: DigitalSreeni

This code will read images from a specified directory and extracts features
using custom-defined feature extractors. In this example, we Calculate entropy, 
roberts, sobel, & few gabor and average the values for all pixels. This gives
us a feature vector of length equal to the number of filters. 

These features from every image in the input folder are captured into
a hdf5 file. This file will be imported to the query_using_custom_features.py 
file to search for similar images to a query image by comparing the feature 
vectors. 

Please note that we are converting image to gray scale. You can read RGB images
and convert them to LAB and use the colors (A & B) to include color information
as features.
