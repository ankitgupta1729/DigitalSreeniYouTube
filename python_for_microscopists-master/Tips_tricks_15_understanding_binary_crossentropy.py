"""
An understanding of binary cross entropy using simple math

Our goal is to assign a class label to an image either as 1 (dog) or 0 (cat).
For that we normally extract features and fit a classifier. 

Let us say our features are float values that go between -1 and 2. 
[-1.8, -0.8, -0.5, -0.1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1.1, 1.5, 1.9]
Also, let us say y_true to be the true labels for the images. 
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Note that 3rd and 6th images are misclassified. 
3rd image is probably a dog that looks like a cat so the features fall in between cat features. 
6th image is probably a dog that looks like a cat so features are close to dog. 

Let us use this premise to calculate BCE using both logloss from scikit learn
and binary cross entropy from keras.
