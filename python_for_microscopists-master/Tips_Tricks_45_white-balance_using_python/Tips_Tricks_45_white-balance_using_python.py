# 1. Gray-world algorithm based white balance

# It assumes that average pixel value is neutral gray (128) because of 
# good distribution of colors. So we can estimate pixel color by looking 
# at the average color. 

# Try the holidays.png image first. Then try lake.png
#This approach works fine on the holidays image but the results from lake
#image can be better. We will use white patch reference for that image later.

#Gray-world algorithm based white balance
#We will convert the image to LAB color space: L for lightness, A for Red/Green and B for Blue/Yellow
#We will calculate the mean color values in A and B channels. 
# Then, subtract 128 (mid gray) from the means and normalize the L channel by
# multiplying with this difference. 
#Finally, subtract this value from A and B channels. 
#Youc can add a multiplication factor to increase/decrease the overall brightness
#of each of the A or B channels. (Here, I added 1.2 as the multiplier)

# possibly because there is no good distribution of colors in this image
