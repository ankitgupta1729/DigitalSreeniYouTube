# ALL ABOUT METADATA IN MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC IMAGES

"""
What is Metadata?
It is the additional information about a file, providing details such as the 
creation date, author, location, pixel size, experimental settings, etc. 

Why is Metadata important? 
For your travel images, it is important so you know when and where the image was taken. 
Please note that metadata is not necessary but useful when some information is
needed at a future date. May be your grandkids want to take a picture in future 
at the same location on your 100th birthday!

For scientific images, it is important to ensure traceability, interoperability,
and reproducibility. 

Metadata provides a detailed history of the image, including acquisition parameters, 
equipment settings, and processing steps. This traceability is crucial for 
tracking the origin and evolution of the data, ensuring accountability and 
transparency in scientific research.

Standardized metadata formats enable different software and systems to understand 
and interpret information consistently. This promotes interoperability, allowing 
researchers to share and collaborate on data across various platforms and tools 
without losing critical details.

Metadata contains essential information about the experimental setup and conditions. 
Reproducing scientific experiments requires accurate knowledge of these factors. 
With comprehensive metadata, other researchers can precisely replicate experiments, 
verify results, and build upon existing work, contributing to the reliability 
and credibility of scientific findings.

Images come in many formats, let us explore metadata from a few most-common 
image formats including JPG, DICOM, TIFF, GEO-TIFF, OME-TIFF, and .CZI

## JPEG/JPG IMAGES

"""
JPEG images - from our phones and cameras

Metadata for JPG images is standardized, and the standard used is called 
Exif (Exchangeable image file format).
JPG typically stores basic metadata like date, camera settings, and location in 
the Exif header.

Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) produced
the initial dfinition of Exif standard. Today, JEITA along with  
Camera & Imaging Products Association (CIPA) defines and maintains 
the Exif standard to ensure compatibility and uniformity in metadata across 
various devices and software that handle digital images.

"""

from PIL import Image

# Open the image
image = Image.open('tower_bridge.jpg')

# Extract the EXIF metadata

## DICOM images ###

DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the international 
standard for medical images. DICOM metadata standards were originally defined by the 
American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical Manufacturers 
Association (NEMA) in 1983 by forming a joint committee. 
Today, the DICOM Standard is managed by the 
Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance - a division of NEMA.

Metadata in DICOM files includes information about the image data, such as size, 
dimensions, bit depth, and modality used to create the data. DICOM metadata 
also includes patient information, image position data, and other relevant details.

TIFF images: 
    
The TIFF format was initially introduced by Aldus Corporation, and the 
first version, TIFF 1.0, was released in 1986. Adobe Systems later became 
involved in the development and standardization of TIFF. Today, Adobe holds the 
copyright on the TIFF specification. 
    

Tiff uses a structured format called the Image File Directory (IFD) to store 
metadata information. The IFD contains tags that define various metadata fields 
such as image dimensions, color space, compression method, and more. 
Each tag in the IFD has a unique identifier (TagID) and is associated with a 
specific metadata field. The raw data for each tag is stored in the TIFF file 
along with its TagType, Count, and Offset.

## OMETIFF FILES

OME-TIFF (Open Microscopy Environment - Tagged Image File Format) is a file 
format designed for microscopy images and metadata. It is an extension of the 
TIFF file format and is part of the broader Open Microscopy Environment (OME) 
initiative. 

OME-TIFF aims to provide a standardized way to store multidimensional microscopy 
data and associated metadata. OME-TIFF stores metadata in a structured way using 
XML embedded within the TIFF file. The XML contains information about the 
microscope settings, acquisition parameters, and other meatadata. 

The metadata in OME-TIFF sticks to the OME Data Model, which defines a standard 
way of representing microscopy-related information.OME Consortium is responsible 
for the development and maintenance of the OME-TIFF standard. 
The OME Consortium is a collaborative effort involving multiple organizations 
and institutions with an interest in open standards for microscopy data.

https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.0.1/

When it comes to python: ometiff files can be read using tifffile library and 
metadata extracted the same way as above, like in regular tiff.
But, let us use apeer_ometiff_library to extract the embedded xml metadata file.

# .czi files

Microscope manufacturers often develop proprietary file formats like .czi for 
many reasons. 

Instrument specific metadata: This includes details like laser settings, 
filter configurations, stage positions, and other instrument-specific parameters.

Efficient Data Storage: Proprietary formats may be optimized for efficient 
data storage, which can be crucial during high-throughput imaging where large 
amounts of data are generated rapidly. These formats may be tailored to the 
specific requirements of the imaging system, potentially allowing for faster 
data acquisition and writing to storage.

Instrument Control and Integration: Proprietary formats are often tightly 
integrated with the manufacturer's instrument control software. This integration 
can enable seamless communication between the microscope hardware and software, 
ensuring accurate representation of experimental parameters and facilitating 
real-time adjustments during acquisition.

Advanced Features and Compression: Some proprietary formats may support advanced 
features specific to certain microscope models, such as multidimensional data, 
time-series imaging, or specialized compression algorithms. These features can 
be optimized for the unique capabilities of the microscope, potentially providing 
advantages in terms of speed and efficiency.

Market Differentiation: Manufacturers may use proprietary formats as a means of 
product differentiation. Having a unique format can encourage users to stick 
with the manufacturer's ecosystem for data analysis and processing, fostering 
brand loyalty.

Most vendors provide a way to save data into ohter formats, including ometiff.

Let us have a look at a .CZI file:
    
These files include a lot of metadata, making almost every aspect of image acquisition
available to the user. Key metadata can be easily accessed using ZEISS' ZEN software. 
A free version is available to open .czi files (ZEN Lite). Of course, imageJ can
be used to read metadata from any file (Image --> Show Info.)

ZEISS' python API (pylibCZIrw) allows for reading and writing .czi files including
access to the extensive metadata.
pip install pylibCZIrw
