"""
Evaluating sklearn model performance using KFold cross validation
(By manually enumerating K-folds.)

Cross-validation: evaluating estimator performance
Using one of the scikit-learn estimators (SVM model)

KFOLD is a model validation technique.

Cross-validation between multiple folds allows us to evaluate the model performance. 

KFold library in sklearn provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. 
Splits dataset into k consecutive folds (without shuffling by default).
Each fold is then used once as a validation while the k - 1 remaining folds 
form the training set.

Split method witin KFold generates indices to split data into training and test set.

The split will divide the data into n_samples/n_splits groups. 
One group is used for testing and the remaining data used for training.
All combinations of n_splits-1 will be used for cross validation.  


In this example, we will first split data into multiple folds and then train the 
model on each fold. We will manually iterate through the training over each fold.
