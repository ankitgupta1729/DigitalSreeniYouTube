Difference between UpSampling2D and Conv2DTranspose

These are the two common types of layers that can be used to increase the dimensions of arrays.

UpSampling2D is like the opposite of pooling where it repeats rows and columns of the input.

Conv2DTranspose performs up-sampling and convolution. 

Conv2DTranspose has been reported to result in Checkerboard artifacts but 
unfortunately not much information on the comparison of UpSampling2D vs Conv2DTranspose.

"""
The Conv2DTranspose upsamples and also performs a convolution. 
Since this includes convolution we need to specify both the size and 
number of filters. We also need to specify stride that gets used for upsampling. 
With a stride of (2,2) the rows and columns of value 0 are inserted to get this stride. 

In this example:
    num_features = 1 (normally we have 64 or 128 or 256 .. etc. )
    kernel size = 1Ã—1
    stride = 2x2 (so a 3x3 image will result as 6x6). 1x1 stride will return the input
Also try stride 3x3 (result will be 9x9 as out input is 3x3 size)

We will initialize kernel by using weights =1. Otherwise it assigns random weights 
and output will not make sense.
