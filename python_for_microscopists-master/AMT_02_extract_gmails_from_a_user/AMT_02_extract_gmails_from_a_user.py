Extract selected mails from your gmail account

1. Make sure you enable IMAP in your gmail settings
(Log on to your Gmail account and go to Settings, See All Settings, and select
 Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab. In the "IMAP access" section, select Enable IMAP.)

2. If you have 2-factor authentication, gmail requires you to create an application
specific password that you need to use. 
Go to your Google account settings and click on 'Security'.
Scroll down to App Passwords under 2 step verification.
Select Mail under Select App. and Other under Select Device. (Give a name, e.g., python)
The system gives you a password that you need to use to authenticate from python.
