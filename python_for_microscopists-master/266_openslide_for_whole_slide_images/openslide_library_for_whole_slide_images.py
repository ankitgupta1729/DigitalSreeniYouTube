OpenSlide can read virtual slides in several formats:

Aperio (.svs, .tif)
Hamamatsu (.ndpi, .vms, .vmu)
Leica (.scn)
MIRAX (.mrxs)
Philips (.tiff)
Sakura (.svslide)
Trestle (.tif)
Ventana (.bif, .tif)
Generic tiled TIFF (.tif)

OpenSlide allows reading a small amount of image data at the resolution 
closest to a desired zoom level.

pip install openslide-python

then download the latest windows binaries
https://openslide.org/download/

Extract the contents to a place that you can locate later.

If you are getting the error: [WinError 126] The specified module could not be found

Open the lowlevel.py file located in:
    lib\site-packages\openslide
    
Add this at the top, after from __future__ import division, in the lowlevel.py
os.environ['PATH'] = "path+to+binary" + ";" + os.environ['PATH']
path+to+binary is the path to your windows binaries that you just downloaded.

In my case, it looks like this.

import os
os.environ['PATH'] = "C:/Users/Admin/anaconda3/envs/py37/lib/site-packages/openslide/openslide-win64-20171122/bin" + ";" + os.environ['PATH']

A few useful commands to locate the sitepackages directory
