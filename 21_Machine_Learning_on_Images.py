# In Traditional Supervised ML, we train a model on training data by giving manual features like
# pixel value, local texture at that pixel value for that we can apply various image processing
# filters like gaussian filter or entropy filter or edge detecting filter or median filters etc.
# we can 100 different filters but it does not matte. As MLE, we have to supply theses features
# to classifier and get an output.

# In Deep Learning, feature extraction and classification are built together as an entity and
# we don't have to do feature engineering.

# If we have limited amount of data then both performs equally well and may be traditional
# ML algorithms like random forest, svm do better job than deep learning. But as we collect
# more and more training data deep learning gives more stable and robust results

# In case of images, regression problem can be between area of scratch in cell and time of
# healing the wound.
